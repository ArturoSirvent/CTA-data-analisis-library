# CTA-data-analisis-library-(incomplete)
This library is a compilation of functions made for statistical analysis on the simulations by CORSIKA.

It's extremely incomplete and by now lack of structure. Is just a functions compilation.

This library is totally incomplete, but the final version of the functions are gathered on my FINAL TFG-notebooks.
